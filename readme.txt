This R Shiny demo runs linear regression on the built-in mtcars dataset.

Use the "Dependent Variable" pick list to choose which variable to use as the dependent variable.
The independent variable will always be mpg (miles per gallon).

After making your selection in the pick list the following will happen:

1. The scatter plot will change to display your chosen independent variable on the x-axis
2. The linear regression line is plotted on the scatter chart
3. The summary of the intercept and slope coefficients are shown in the table below the scatter chart

Have fun!
